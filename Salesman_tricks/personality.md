# Personality

Personality is the first and most important key point of the good salesman because this is the first thing which the 
client or customer saw. He is not aware of the product neither he will see it first. You are the first person whom he 
gonna see it. So , before meeting a client make sure for the following things :- 

Be well dressed :- Its not all about that you are full of your wardrobe. Its only about your dressing sense. Wear clean
and ironed proper formal dress. Semi formal is also fine with little good fragerance perfume and cleaned mouth(use mouth wash).

Choose right hairstyle according to your cloths.

In short , you should pick up your wardrobes , shoes and hairstyle in such a way which looks you a smart ,simple and 
decent-gentleman.

Because its not  a fashion show where you are showing your wardrobes . It is formal meeting to a client 
your personality should be simple and attractive with the confidence and neutral attitude (neigther low esteemed nor 
high esteemed) because nobody wants to talk with a high esteemed person and consider him/her as egostic and everybody 
will suppress a low esteemed person by dominating their views.
