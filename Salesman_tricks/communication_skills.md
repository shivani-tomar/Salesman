This is the second key point for a salesman which matters a lot as his/her vocab is the only way through which client 
started imagine about the product and many more things. So, it matters a lot how you explain things to others.

This is the key point, while explaining a product to others , use positive words . For example - if you are selling a pen cost rupees 5/- only then use word economic rather than cheaper or cheap.Because cheap is a word describing low standard while economic is a word which represent profit and everybody wants profit.

Below are some techniques which are very effective for a salesman :-

While meeting to client or customer , Greet him/her with a proper handshake (equal pressure from both sides and strong showing confidence). For Example - you meet to Mr. X talking about a product idea and want to explain it .The conversation will go aheadlike this :-

you:- Hello Mr. X , How are you ?
X  :- Hi , I am good and enjoying the work. What about you ?
you:- My world is also seems heaven and properly enjoying it. Last night , while going to bed I was thinking that there 
      should be like this.
X  :- Oh! Could you expalin it briefly ?
you:- Yes , of course! Then started explaining your idea or product.
