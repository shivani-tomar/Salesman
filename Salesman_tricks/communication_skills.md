# Communication Skills

This is the second key point for a salesman which matters a lot as his/her vocab is the only way through which client 
started imagine about the product and many more things. So, it matters a lot how you explain things to others.

This is the key point, while explaining a product to others , use positive words . For example - if you are selling a pen cost rupees 5/- only then use word economic rather than cheaper or cheap.Because cheap is a word describing low standard while economic is a word which represent profit and everybody wants profit.

Below are some techniques which are very effective for a salesman :-

While meeting to client or customer , Greet him/her with a proper handshake (equal pressure from both sides and strong showing confidence). For Example - you meet to Mr. X talking about a product idea and want to explain it .The conversation will go aheadlike this :-

you:- Hello Mr. X , How are you ?
X  :- Hi , I am good and enjoying the work. What about you ?
you:- My world is also seems heaven and properly enjoying it. Last night , while going to bed I was thinking that there 
      should be like this.
X  :- Oh! Could you expalin it briefly ?
you:- Yes , of course! Then started explaining your idea or product.

Communication goes on in many phases during the start of project till delivery of the projet. So keep a friendly relationship with your clients. Below I am going to describe few phases of sdlc(software development life cycle) cycle and communication during these phase.

Phase - I (understanding requirements):- This is very initial phase of software development in which you gather the information about what type of software client want. In this phase the communication goes on between you and client on totally imagination basis in which he told you his requirements and you need to understand them in which your words matter a lot.

Below conversation is an example in which suppose client want you to develop a special type of chair for the use of home cum office i.e. he want a chair which can be used in office but give a comfort like you are sitting at home. Now , such type of chair neither the client has seen nor you. So, he would tell you to develop it and have no other responsibility.Its your responsibility to ask what type of seat should be in chair . How about arms of chair and legs and try to use less technical words in conversatins as nobody is pure technical side and don't understand  techy words. Lets see it through a conversation given below:-

Client : - I want a chair and I want to use it in my office but it should be stylish and comfortable.

You :- Ok, sir. Could you please briefly elaborate about how its legs should be and arms and seats.

Client : - I want a thin but bouncy seat for my chair with comfortable sitting zone as thick seats sweats a lot .              Chair's base should be movable without scraching floor and making no sound with wheels. Height of chair                could be done flexible on the basis of requirements. Arms of chair should be in such a way that no one              get uncomforatable while working. Back also shoud be comfortable without aching anybody's backbone. I                want something for head support. Add a cup like structure to one of its arm to keep my stationary as I              used to forget to keep it always with a reading board.In back side of chair , there should be a pocket              to keep notebooks and other accessaries like charger , ear phone . There should be some hook like                    structure to hang tiffin bags or something. I want hidden cupboard to keep small accessories with lock              based on three digit codes on one of its arm.

You : - Alright Sir , any other attribute which you want to add in it.

Client : - No, I think its enough.

You : - Sir, how much flexible back you want In terms of confort zone.

Client:- I want maximum 120 degree angle flexible back with its seat .

You : - How many wheels you want in your chair ?

And such type of conversation goes on to gather all neccessary requirements.
